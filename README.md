### 2. Please describe any unique characteristics or distinctive qualities of your school and your special interests, ability in academic areas during secondary school period.
Unique characteristics or distinctive qualities of my school:


One of the key and distinguishing features of my lyceum, which played a crucial role in my choice to study there, is the respect, understanding, and support not only from students but also from teachers, educators, and even the service staff. Perhaps, this trait wouldn't be so distinctive, but over time, people change, losing this quality, which significantly affects our country.
In addition to this, my lyceum also places a strong emphasis on global-mindedness. The founders, young, talented, and educated entrepreneurs of our country, laid the defining qualities from its foundation. They became initiators and founders who indirectly influenced our thinking and behavior. Surveys indicate that many students, as well as mentors, had never before considered the global perspective, and they also never had healthy relationships with mentors and/or students.
These two intertwined characteristics - respect and global-mindedness - have created a unique environment in my lyceum. These qualities not only foster a healthy atmosphere and strengthen relationships within the lyceum community but also contribute to a broader perspective on the world. The commitment to global-mindedness ensures that students and mentors alike are encouraged to think beyond local boundaries, fostering a more inclusive and interconnected worldview. This dual focus on respect and global-mindedness sets my lyceum apart, allowing it to maintain a commendable academic and ethical standard while preparing its members to navigate an increasingly interconnected global society.

## 3. Ability in academic areas during secondary school period:

One of my specific and, at the same time, instructive activities during secondary school, which later evolved into something more significant, was my fascination with chess. In general, chess can teach a lot. The tactics applied for victory can be useful in something more important. Here are a few examples: Sometimes, to win, you need to sacrifice something; it may even seem absurd. Losing the queen does not mean defeat. Allied pieces are not always helpful and can sometimes be harmful. This is just a small part of various tactics that are equally relevant in real life.
Having delved into the captivating world of chess, I found it to be an enthralling, enchanting, and dynamic universe. My father first noticed my talent for the game shortly after I began learning its basics. Within a few months, I was able to outplay individuals much older than me.
Recognizing my potential, my father enrolled me in specialized training. However, faced with an incompetent coach, he decided to transfer me to another location, despite its considerable distance from our residence. My mother played a crucial role during this period, accompanying me to lessons and offering support during challenging moments. Without her assistance, I might have remained just a casual player.
As the years passed, tangible results emerged - a deepened understanding of the game and podium finishes in competitions. However, in 2018, a setback at an international tournament dampened my enthusiasm. Despite a streak of failures, I knew that persistent effort and knowledge were crucial elements for achieving global success.
Though my desire to engage with chess waned for a while, I maintained faith in the power of determination and hard work. This belief became evident when I broke the streak of failures, earning my final medal at a blitz tournament, thereby proving that perseverance and diligence are paramount factors for success in the captivating world of chess.
In conclusion, my journey with chess has been a transformative odyssey, shaping not only my strategic thinking on the chessboard but also influencing my approach to life's challenges. Chess has proven to be more than just a game; it is a repository of valuable life lessons. The ability to sacrifice for a greater goal, the understanding that setbacks do not equate to defeat, and the awareness that allies can sometimes be liabilities—all these tactical nuances have seamlessly transcended the boundaries of the chessboard and manifested in my everyday life.

### 4. Please explain any of your extracurricular activities or work experience.
Teaching others makes us stronger. With this in mind, I became a co-founder of the Olympiad Programming Club at my school. The idea originally belonged to our teacher but materialized only after his departure. My close friend and I took on all the responsibilities, evenly distributing the workload between us. The key role during its creation was to pass on the knowledge we already possessed because no one else in our school could mentor newcomers. The ultimate goal was to educate our students to a level where, after our departure, they could confidently achieve commendable results in international and national competitions.

As a co-founder, part of my responsibilities involved overseeing the club 2-3 times a week and, when needed, explaining complex topics that the founder himself couldn't articulate clearly. Having been in a similar club before, which later disbanded because the teacher and older students left the school, I was able to recognize the advantages of such a community, but now from the perspective of a teacher, co-founder, and simply a more experienced student. To explain certain complex concepts in a comprehensible manner—concepts I didn't grasp at that age due to the absence of someone who could explain everything in detail and clearly—I understood how important it is to organize everything correctly and explain it clearly. To achieve this, I had to carefully consider the lesson plan to ensure that the material was fully understood.

Thanks to these factors, our students have started taking their first steps into the world of competitive programming. Equally important is the establishment of good relationships not only as student and student but also as student and teacher. We also invited a friend from the younger classes who could take our place after our departure.

In conclusion, this journey as a co-founder, teacher, and leader of the programming club has provided me with the opportunity to share my knowledge with others. I've guided new students into the wonderful and fascinating world of programming, making their initial steps less challenging than mine. This, in turn, allows them to become stronger in a shorter time. The experience has been both rewarding and fulfilling, reinforcing my belief in the transformative power of education and mentorship.
